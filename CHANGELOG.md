## 2.0.1

- Naming consistency refactor: `FieldScopeQuery` is returned instead of `FieldScope` (kept and deprecated for compatibility for now).

## 2.0.0

**Breaking changes**
- `FieldScope.field`, `FieldCompareQuery.field` and `FieldCompareQuery.operator` are now a `TextQuery`.
- `field:<exp>` and `field <operator> <exp>`: `<exp>` can now be an empty string.
- `TextQuery.isExact` and `PhraseQuery.isExact` are removed. `PhraseQuery` is always exact and `TextQuery` never is.

**Updated**
- Added `SourcePosition` to `Query`, storing the `start` and `end` index of the matching input.
